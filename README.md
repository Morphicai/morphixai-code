2. **Start preview server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
3. **Start developing**
   - Browser will automatically open showing your app
   - Start programming in the `src/app/` folder
   - If using AI editor, you can converse with AI in Chinese to generate code


## 🤖 AI Smart Development Examples

### Natural Language Programming
Through AI conversation, you can describe requirements in natural language to develop applications:

#### Example Conversation 1: Create Component
```
You: Help me create a user profile card component with avatar, name, bio, and follow button

AI: I'll create a user profile card component for you:

1. Create src/app/components/UserProfile.jsx
2. Create src/app/styles/UserProfile.module.css
3. Use modern UI components and MorphixAI specifications
4. Include responsive design and beautiful animations
```

#### Example Conversation 2: Add Functionality
```
You: Add like functionality to the user card and save to local storage

AI: I'll add like functionality to the user card:

1. Use useState to manage like state
2. Integrate StorageAPI for local storage
3. Add like animation effects
4. Include error handling
```

#### Example Conversation 3: Style Adjustments
```
You: Make the card more modern, add shadow effects and rounded corners

AI: I'll optimize the card styling:

1. Update CSS Module styles
2. Add modern shadow effects
3. Optimize border radius and spacing
4. Ensure mobile adaptation
```
